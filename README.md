# ML-lab-SSN
The Machine Learning Lab helped to understand the various concepts ranging from Hebb and Perceptron networks to advanced Deep Neural Networks. Here we tried implementing them using Python.

Data Visualization was also a part of this lab which helps in understanding various aspects of data thereby choosing or processing them to match our needs.

Various algorithms and their applications were understood in this lab.
